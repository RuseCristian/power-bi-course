	Checked out what power BI is, what it can do, how it got developed, check out the interface, tools and posibilities of power BI, alongside making a simple dashboard with a premade csv dataset about jobs
	
	Made a more complex dashboard and focused a lot on the options available in the visualization chart, labels titles, axis options still utilizing the same job dataset
	 etc
	

 is dedicated to to trialing out each option in the visualization chart

A very used one, stacked Bar Chart, made one for the highest paying jobs titles, showcasing the median yearly salary for each position. Decided to show median instead of average salary
	as average tends to show skewed results due to either few high performing outliers or underperforimg ones, therefore the median, appears to be more valuable as it shows a better general picture of the realities for each position
	Also first worked with advanced filters, to filter on the y axis job titles which were not related to data jobs, such as machine learning or software engineering, by specifying that the job title should contain the word "data".
	
	
	Utilized a clustered column chart to display the average yearly salary per month for the top 4 countries in order of how many jobs there are in said countries, worldwide
		stacked column chart, displaying the amount of positions which require a degree vs ones which do not for a particular job position
	 stacked bar chart working off  2.3, but instead displaying percentages of degree vs no degree requirements
	
learned about line charts, trendlines, min, and max, and analytics tab in general and drills, Stacked charts, and stacked percentage Charts, line and stacked column charts
	
 played with pie and donut charts, treemap and scattered charts, learned about having a cohesive list color scheme throught the whole dashboard so that it does not get distracting
	learned about interactions and how to edit them
	
	Map charts - played with map charts and arcgis maps, blah blah, payed more attention to tooltips
	
	Tables And matrixes - learned to use tables and matrixes and also played with conditional formatting
	
	Cards- Multiple cards, simple cards, new cards, gauge cards,multi row cards and kpi cards
	
	Slicers- played with all types of slicers, adapted them for various situations multi input, single input, searches, dropdown, entity whatever the fuck is called, also added syncing between all of them, and clear button
	
	made a comprehensive job dashboard, learned about layers, and drill through, as i also made a drill through page
	
	
	
	
 first delved into power bi power query, first of all tested the web urls to get data directly from the web, test with this website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)
	to get the GDP of countries.
	
		played with folders and automatically updating when adding new files into the folders
		tested with databases too, loaded with google big query for america health ratings
		
		
	
	played with data imports and transforms, learned about refferences , also cross refferences
	
	
	advanced transformation, cleaned up the tables, made new table for job type ( part time, full time etc ) then cleared it and edited it too etc
	cleaned up the job skills using a multitude of conditional columns, capitalization and replace values
	
	
	
	
	
	append and merge queries
	
	worked with multiple mothly reports and appended them 
	
	merged a star schema into a flat one
	played with M language to change data, colums, queries etc
	
	
	column from example with m language
	M language is used at data import
	whilst dax is used at query run time
	DAX and M language 
	difference between calculated columns and measures, measures are calculated at query run time, whilst claulcated columns are on data import
	
	explicit measures
	
	dax best practices for explicit measures, _Measures, apare sus, toate measurile pe care le facem puise in measures
	
	row context, query context, filter context
	
	learned about parameters
